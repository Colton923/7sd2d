# 7 Days to Die Server Project - Gemini Resume

## Goal
To create a robust, automated system for building and deploying a modded 7 Days to Die server using Docker, GitHub Actions, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## Current Status
- We have a working `Dockerfile` that uses the reliable LinuxGSM scripts to install the game server.
- We have a `.gitignore` file to correctly exclude large mod and world files from the Git repository.
- We have a GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) that is set up to trigger when code is pushed to the `master` branch.
- The project has been pushed to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Colton923/7sd2d.git`

## The Problem We Are Solving
The GitHub Actions build is failing. This is expected. The `.gitignore` file is correctly preventing the large `local_mods` directory from being uploaded to GitHub. Therefore, when the workflow tries to build the Docker image, the `COPY local_mods/...` command fails because the folder doesn't exist on the GitHub runner.

## The Plan: Your Next Steps
To solve this, we will use Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to hold the mods. When you are ready to resume, please perform the following actions:

1.  **Create a GCS Bucket:**
    *   Go to the Google Cloud Storage browser: [https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser)
    *   Click **Create bucket**.
    *   Give it a globally unique name (e.g., `colton923-7d2d-mods`).
    *   Choose a location (e.g., the same region you plan for your server).
    *   Use the default settings and click **Create**.

2.  **Prepare and Upload Your Mods:**
    *   On your local PC, find your `C:\Users\admin\projects\7d2d\local_mods` directory.
    *   Create a `.zip` file containing the **contents** of this directory. Name the zip file `7d2d-mods.zip`.
    *   In the Google Cloud console, navigate into the bucket you just created.
    *   Click **Upload files** and upload your `7d2d-mods.zip`.

## When You Return
Once you have completed the two steps above, tell me the following:
1.  That you have completed the steps.
2.  The name of the GCS bucket you created.

I will then modify the `Dockerfile` and the GitHub Actions workflow to securely download the mods from the bucket during the build process.
