## What's Working Right Now

### Immediate RPG Features (XML-Based):
1. **Procedural Weapons** - 210+ unique weapons spawn with:
   - Elemental damage properties
   - Weapon affixes (damage, accuracy, critical chance bonuses)
   - Quality tiers and mastery requirements
   - Economic balancing

2. **Enhanced Loot System** - Weapons spawn in:
   - Supply crates with proper rarity weighting
   - Trader inventories with level-appropriate gear
   - Zombie loot with balanced drop rates

3. **Weapon Progression** - Players find increasingly powerful weapons:
   - Tier-based progression (T1-T6)
   - Quality scaling (1-600)
   - Mastery requirements for advanced weapons

## Testing Instructions

### In-Game Testing:
1. **Start a new world** or load existing save
2. **Open console** (F1) and verify mod loading:
   ```
   lp mod
   ```
   Should show "RPG Overhaul TypeScript" in the list

3. **Test procedural weapons:**
   ```
   giveselfitem Worn_Tediore_pistol_T1Q53_gunHan
   giveselfitem Advanced_Jakobs_rifle_T3Q180_gunRif
   ```

4. **Check weapon properties:**
   - Inspect weapons to see elemental damage types
   - Note mastery requirements and quality ratings
   - Observe economic values and tier classifications

### Debug Commands Available:
```
lp mod  # List all loaded mods
giveselfitem [weapon_name]  # Spawn specific weapons
debugweather  # Enable debug mode for additional logging
```

## Next Steps for Full C# Implementation

To activate the complete runtime system:

1. **Resolve Unity Dependencies:**
   - Remove UI components or implement using 7D2D's native UI system
   - Create compatibility layer for UnityEngine.UI components

2. **Complete C# Build:**
   ```bash
   cd rpg-overhaul-csharp
   # Fix compilation errors
   dotnet build RPGOverhaul.csproj
   ```

3. **Deploy C# DLL:**
   ```bash
   cp bin/Release/RPGOverhaul.dll "/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/7 Days To Die/Mods/7D2D-RPGOverhaul/"
   ```
